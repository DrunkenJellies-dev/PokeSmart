## Deployment:

### Pre deployment

- To ensure successful deployment with heroku, it's good practice to make sure that the requirements.txt file is kept up to date so as that imported python modules are configured correctly.
- A Procfile is required to allow heroku deployment to be configured to a gunicorn web app.
- In settings.py configure the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost'], make sure all static files and directories are configured correctly.
- All environment variables on the env.py which gitignored on the repo must be configured correctly with the database url and secret key.

### Deploying with heroku

After account setup, the steps were as follows:

1.  Create a New App on Heroku:
    - Log into your Heroku account.
    - Click on "Create new app" and provide a unique name for your app.
    - Choose the region for your app (e.g., Europe).
    - Click "Create app".
2.  Connect to GitHub:
    - In the deployment method section, select GitHub.
    - Search for your GitHub repository and click "Connect".
3.  Configure Deployment Settings:
    - Choose between manual or automatic deployment. For automatic deployment, ensure the main branch is selected.
    - In the settings tab, reveal config vars and input the required hidden variables.
4.  Set Buildpacks:
    - Go to the settings tab and select "Buildpacks".
    - Add Node.js and Python as the buildpacks for your application.
5.  Deploy Your App: - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process. - After the first deployment, you will receive a message indicating that your app was successfully deployed. - Use the "View" button to access your deployed application.
    This process leverages Heroku's integration with GitHub to automate the deployment of your application, making it easier to manage and update your project.
